# Clean-MicrosoftStreamVttFile

Cleans a Microsoft Stream VTT file, so that you get only the spoken text.

Description
A VTT file from Microsoft Stream contains more informations than only the transcripted text. This code removes the extra informations and saves the text in a file.
This is inspired by the VTTCleaner web site from Marc Mroz.
